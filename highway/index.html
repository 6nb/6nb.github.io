            <strong>Steps to afk clogging the highways with Constructors highway tools:</strong>
            <br><br>1. Download <a href="https://github.com/lambda-client/lambda/releases/tag/3.0.1">lambda client</a> and install highway tools plugin 10.3 and put it in your lambda mod folder.
            <br><br>2. Open lambda using "y" and search for highway tools.
            <br><br>3. Once under module, be under the "build" menu.
            <br><br>4. Switch mode to "digging", and change width to 7 and height to 3 (To work on 5 wide with railings). Then turn on backfill.
            <br><br>5. Under the "behavior" menu, have dynamic place delay = on, place and break delay = minimum, mining speed = 2, illegal placements = on, briding = on, instant mine = on, more packets = on, shuffle tasks = off, task timeout = 10, rubberband timeout = 50, max reach = 4.9, multi break = 5, limited by = fixed, limit factor = 2, deep search = 4, packet move = 1.
            <br><br>6. Under the "storage management" menu, have everything off except manage food (if you're using food shulkers).
            <br><br>7. Under the "config" menu, keep everything default or change it up to your liking. 
            <br><br>8. Search for "auto obsidian" in lambda.
            <br><br>9. Once in, have fill inventory = on, leave empty shulkers = off, auto refill = on, refill threshold = 2, delay ticks = 1, rotation = off, max reach = 4.9
            <br><br>10. Search for "inventory manager"
            <br><br>11. Turn on auto refill and make refill threshold = 3. Everything else can be off.
            <br><br>12. Have "auto eat", fast break, fast place, nopacketkick, and "antiforcelook" on.
            <br><br>13. Set auto log to players.
            <br><br>14. Set highway tools and auto obsidian to the same keybind.
            <br><br>15. Type, ";ht filler obsidian" in chat as netherrack is the default.
            <br><br>15. Turn it on, and it should fully afk with no problems.
            <br><br>16. Trollage begins.
